# Faster R-CNN Object Detection on Heridal Dataset

## Overview

This project focuses on training a Faster R-CNN model using the Heridal dataset and the detectron2 framework. The goal is to achieve accurate object detection on the Heridal dataset and evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.

## Dataset

The Heridal dataset is a curated collection of images and corresponding bounding box annotations for object detection tasks. It covers a wide range of objects across different categories, providing diverse and representative samples for training and evaluation.

## Metrics

Based on the evaluation of the Faster R-CNN model on the Heridal dataset, the following metrics were achieved:

    Precision: 0.604
    Recall: 0.003
    Mean Average Precision (mAP): 0.202
    Mean Average Precision at IoU=0.5 (mAP50): 0.604
    Mean Average Precision at IoU=0.75 (mAP75): 0.056
    Frames per Second (FPS): 6.95

These metrics provide insights into the model's precision, recall, average precision, and frame rate. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Faster R-CNN model in accurately detecting objects in the Heridal dataset.
